                current and future Agreements, deliveries, commercial relationships and other legal
                relationships between the Parties. The General Terms and Conditions of the Client
                are expressly rejected.
            </li>
            <li>

                in writing with The Green Plus.
            </li>
            <li>
                The applicability of purchase or other terms and conditions of the Client are

            </li>
            <li>
                If it appears that a provision or more provisions in these General Terms and
                Conditions are invalid, the validity of the other provisions of these General Terms
                and Conditions as well as the entire Agreement will not be affected. In such a case,
                the parties will endeavor to replace the invalid provision with a new, valid
                provision that approximates the invalid provision as closely as possible within the
                scope of the original General Terms and Conditions.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Article 4 Offer and conclusion of the Agreement</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                All offers on the Website are without obligation, unless expressly stated otherwise.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Client can contact The Green Plus via the Website or email for one of the
                Services offered.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Green Plus will consult with the Client about its expectations and can then
                prepare a quotation that will be sent by letter or e-mail. The Agreement is only
                concluded by signing the quotation or by means of an (electronic) order
                confirmation.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Green Plus will provide the Client with an estimate of its consultancy costs
                when the Agreement is concluded. The Client cannot derive any rights from this
                estimate, unless any exceeding cannot reasonably be charged to the Client.
            </li>
            <li>
                If The Green Plus sends a confirmation to the Client, that confirmation gives
                direction to the content and explanation of the Agreement, subject to obvious
                clerical errors. The Green Plus cannot be held to its offer if the Client can
                reasonably understand that the offer, or a part thereof, contains an obvious mistake
                or error.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the Client makes notes or provides responses to The Green Plus' quotation, they

            </li>
            <li>
                An assignment by the Client that has not been preceded by a written quotation
                requires written acceptance by The Green Plus.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Article 5 Performance of the Agreement</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The Green Plus will make every effort to perform the Services to the best of its
                knowledge and ability and in accordance with the requirements of good workmanship,
                and as much as possible in accordance with the agreements laid down in writing.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Green Plus has the right to have certain activities performed by third parties.
            </li>
            <li>
                When engaging third parties, The Green Plus will exercise due care and will consult
                with the Client in the selection of these third parties, as far as this is
                reasonably possible and customary in the relationship with the Client. The costs of
                engaging these third parties will be borne by the Client and will be charged by The
                Green Plus to the Client.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Agreement can only be performed by The Green Plus if the Client provides
                complete and correct (contact) details to The Green Plus when concluding the
                Agreement. The Client will therefore ensure that all information, which The Green
                Plus indicates is necessary or which the Client should reasonably understand to be
                necessary for the performance of the Agreement, is provided to The Green Plus in a
                timely manner.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Client shall ensure that The Green Plus can provide its Services in a timely and
                proper manner. If the Client does not comply with its agreements in this regard, it
                is obliged to compensate the resulting damage.
            </li>
            <li>
                If a term has been agreed or specified for the performance of Services or delivery
                of Products, this is never a strict deadline. If a term is exceeded, the Client must
                give The Green Plus written notice of default. The Green Plus must be offered a
                reasonable term to still implement the Agreement.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Article 6 CO2 compensation</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                After concluding an Agreement for CO2 compensation, The Green Plus provides a tool
                with which (customers of) the Client can compensate the emission of the amount of
                CO2 of his trip when buying tickets, against payment of a certain price.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Green Plus has developed its own emission calculation methodology, which can be
                accessed via API integration, based on the latest scientific insights. Using this
                tool, The Green Plus is able to calculate the required emissions for each type of
                travel mode. To compensate for these calculated emissions, Green Plus purchases its
                carbon credits on the market through official brokers. As soon as a Client has
                purchased a service from The Green Plus, The Green Plus will settle the carbon
                credits for its Client via The Green Plus' own register/account.
            </li>
            <li>
                As soon as possible after the conclusion of an Agreement for the provision of CO2
                compensation by The Green Plus for the Client, but no later than 12 months after the
                end of the financial year, the CO2 compensation will take place for the Client.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the characteristics of CO2 credits from the Agreement between the parties are not
                specified in more detail or if the projects desired by the Client do not meet the
                independent verification for whatever reason, or if they produce insufficient CO2
                credits to meet the Client's request The Green Plus is entirely free to choose
                another project of comparable quality to which the CO2 credits to be registered in
                the Client's name relate.
            </li>
            <li>
                If there are changes in legislation and regulations in the country of origin of the
                CO2 credits and where the country of origin announces that the CO2 credits of the
                agreed project will be included in achieving its own NDC emission target, If
                desired, The Green Plus can make an effort to replace CO2 credits from a project of
                comparable quality. If The Green Plus is unable to supply the alternative CO2
                credits within one year, the Parties are entitled to terminate the Agreement. With
                this contract termination there is no contractual liability for one of the Parties.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Green Plus retains all rights at all times to the CO2 credits it has purchased
                for the Client or registered in the Client's name, unless explicitly agreed
                otherwise.
            </li>
            <li>
                The CO2 credits registered by The Geen Plus for or in the name of the Client may
                never be encumbered, sold, delivered or otherwise traded by the Client to or for the
                benefit of a third party, unless expressly agreed otherwise.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Green Plus only guarantees the amount of the CO2 compensation it has supplied.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Client is not authorized to unilaterally change the tonnage of CO2 referred to
                in the Agreement in the interim, unless the Client can submit demonstrable CO2
                reduction measures to The Green Plus.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Article 7 Advice</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                When providing advice, The Green Plus only has an obligation of best efforts and no
                obligation of result. A best-efforts obligation is a contractual obligation to make
                the necessary efforts or to use certain resources to achieve the stipulated result,
                which means that The Green Plus cannot guarantee that the outcomes, results or
                expectations that the Client has when providing Services envisaged will actually be
                achieved.
            </li>
            <li>
                The advice is given exclusively for the benefit of the Client. Third parties cannot
                derive any rights from this.
            </li>
            <li>
                If an advisor is unable to attend, The Green Plus will arrange for a replacement. If
                The Green Plus cannot reasonably (timely) arrange for the replacement of an advisor,
                The Green Plus is not liable for any damage that the Client may suffer as a result.
                The Green Plus is only obliged to comply with agreements under the Agreement at a
                time to be determined in consultation with the Client.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Article 8 Amendment to the Agreement</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                If during the execution of the Agreement it appears that it is necessary for a
                proper execution to change or supplement it, The Green Plus and the Client will
                proceed to adjust the Agreement in good time and in mutual consultation.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the Agreement is amended, including an addition, this constitutes an additional
                assignment. A separate agreement about the fee will be made in advance about this
                additional assignment. Without an additional quotation, the original conditions
                apply, whereby the extra Services are paid for at the agreed rate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Not or not immediately executing the amended Agreement does not constitute a breach
                of contract on the part of The Green Plus and is no ground for the Client to
                terminate or dissolve the Agreement.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Article 9 Suspension, dissolution and early termination of the Agreement</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The Green Plus is authorized to suspend the fulfillment of the obligations or to
                dissolve the Agreement if the Client does not, not fully or not timely fulfill the
                obligations under the Agreement, or if The Green Plus has good reason to fear that
                the Client will fail to fulfill those obligations, provided that The Green Plus has
                given the Client notice of default by means of a written reminder, whereby the
                Client is given a reasonable term for compliance with the obligations, and
                compliance is not forthcoming within this term.
            </li>
            <li>
                Furthermore, The Green Plus is authorized to dissolve the Agreement, under the same
                conditions as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, if circumstances arise of
                such a nature that fulfillment of the Agreement is impossible or if unaltered
                maintenance of the Agreement is not reasonably possible. can be required.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the Client fails to fulfill its obligations arising from the Agreement, this
                non-compliance justifies dissolution and the Client is in default, The Green Plus is
                entitled to terminate the Agreement immediately and with immediate effect by means
                of a written statement to the Client, whereby The client, on account of default, is
                obliged to pay compensation or indemnification.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Article 10 Cancellation</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cancellation of the Agreement is no longer possible after the CO2 compensation has
                taken place. The CO2 compensation is made at the moment that the trip has actually
                taken place.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Article 11 Costs, remuneration and payment</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                All amounts stated in offers, quotations, invoices and agreements are in euros and
                include VAT, unless stated otherwise.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Green Plus has the right to correct apparently incorrect errors in the
                quotation.
            </li>
            <li>
                After the conclusion of an Agreement for CO2 compensation, the Client can use the
                tool intended for that purpose. Based on the use of this tool, monthly payment
                obligations for the Client towards The Green Plus arise on behalf of the Client's
                customers.
            </li>
            <li>
                If a trip of the Client's customer is canceled for whatever reason, the compensation
                of the CO2 is logically no longer necessary and the amount already paid will be
                refunded to the Client.
            </li>
            <li>Payment is made afterwards by means of invoicing via bank transfer or iDeal.</li>
            <li>The invoice must be paid by the Client within 14 (fourteen) days.</li>
            <li>
                If one or more cost price factors undergo an increase after the Agreement has been
                concluded - even if this occurs as a result of foreseeable circumstances - The Green
                Plus is entitled to increase the agreed price accordingly.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Client is obliged to immediately inform The Green Plus of any inaccuracies in
                the payment details stated or provided.
            </li>

                If the Client fails to pay an invoice on time, the Client will be in default by
                operation of law, without further notice of default being required. The client will
                then owe the statutory interest. The interest on the amount due and payable will be

                interest referred to in Article 12.8, also obliged to pay all reasonable legal and

        <h5>Article 12 Retention of title</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                All goods delivered by The Green Plus remain the property of The Green Plus, for as
                long as these goods have not been paid off or have not been paid in full.
            </li>
            <li>
                Insofar as The Green Plus's retention of title is null and void through the
                formation of a business or otherwise, The Green Plus reserves the right to establish
                a non-possessory pledge on an item, as security for all that which the Client still
                owes or will owe to The Green Plus. The Client must establish this non-possessory
                pledge at The Green Plus's first request.

        <h5>Article 13 Liability</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The Green Plus is never liable for any damage whatsoever, unless there is damage as
                a result of gross negligence and/or intent on the part of The Green Plus.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Client is responsible for providing correct and representative data and
                information necessary for the performance of the Agreement. The Green Plus is not
                liable for damage if the Client has provided incorrect, unrepresentative or
                irrelevant information.
            </li>
            <li>
                Although every effort will be made to comply with the delivery term, The Green Plus
                is never liable for the consequences of exceeding the term stated there. Exceeding
                the term does not entitle the Client to cancel the Agreement, or to refuse receipt
                or payment of the Products, nor does The Green Plus owe any compensation to the
                Client.

                liable for dissatisfaction on the part of the Client with regard to the advice
                provided.
            </li>
            <li>

            <li>
                If The Green Plus is held liable, it will only be liable for direct damage actually
                incurred, paid or suffered by the Client due to a demonstrable failure in the
                obligations of The Green Plus with regard to its Services
            </li>
            <li>
                The Green Plus' liability is limited to the amount covered and paid out by the
                insurer. If the insurer does not pay out, or if The Green Plus is not insured, the
                liability is limited to the amount paid by the Client.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any claim against The Green Plus, except claims that have been acknowledged by The
